# Learning Image Processing
This repository includes my work in the journey to learn Image Processing.

the repository consists of 9 labs covering fundamental topics in Image Processing.

> ### Lab3: Smoothing
- median filter to noisy image with S&P

- Gaussian filter with different sigma

 > ### Lab4: Contrast Enhancement
- Negative transformation

 > ### Lab5: Edge Detection
- Applying Roberts and Sobel edge detectors

 > ### Lab6: Morphology
- Applying erosion and dilation to coins

 - Skeltonize the horse Vs thin by only 20 iteration

 > ### Lab7: Segmentation 1
- Segmenting the grass from the image by calculating the distance from grass color, then apply threshold.
 ![segmentation by threshold and distance](/lab07-Segmentation/output/grass.png)
 
  > ### Lab8: Segmentation 2 - adaptive thresholding techniques
- histogram automatic thresholding technique result in threshold = 89.
